-   Import data into a tidy structure
-   Format, filter and manipulate your datasets in preparation for plotting
:::

The **dplyr** package is specifically designed for data formatting and manipulation and allows you to merge datasets and create new columns as well as filtering and summarising your data. We are going to learn some of the most common functions.

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

First, make sure the tidyverse package is loaded and you have read in the `surveys` dataset.

```{r results='hidden'}
library(tidyverse)
surveys <- read_csv("surveys_complete.csv")
```

To select columns of a tibble, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data frame `surveys`, and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r eval=F, purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To drop columns from a tibble, put a "-" in front of the variable to exclude it.

```{r eval=F, purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id` and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r eval=F, purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this:

-   Intermediate objects
-   Nested functions
-   Pipes

With intermediate objects, you create a temporary tibble and use that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually and keep track of.

You can also *nest* functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested. R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The alternative is to use *pipes*. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **magrittr** package, installed automatically with **dplyr**. If you use RStudio, the keyboard shortcut for a pipe is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>.

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

Here we are 'piping' the `surveys` dataset through the `filter()` function, then through `select()`. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the tibble as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`ed for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **dplyr** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
surveys_sml
```

R version 4.1 introduced a native pipe which can be used in base R without loading the magrittr or tidyverse packages. It uses the alternative `|>` symbol. There are some subtle differences with this pipe which you can read about [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/the-new-r-pipe/). You can change the `CTRL+ALT+M` keyboard shortcut to use the native pipe in Code section of RStudio's Global Options.

## Exporting data

Similar to the `read_csv()` function there is also a `write_csv()` function. If you want to export any of your newly created datasets you can do this as follows:

```{r, eval=F}
##Create a data folder
dir.create("data")

write_csv(surveys_sml, file = "data/surveys_small.csv")
#Or use write_tsv for tab separated files
```

You can even pipe directly into `write_csv` to avoid creating another R object.

```{r, eval=F}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) %>% 
  write_csv(file = "data/surveys_small.csv")
```

## Mutate

Frequently, you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to combine values from two columns. For this we use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight * 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight * 1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)
```

If you just want to see the first few rows, you can use a pipe to one of the `head` commands. Base R has `head()` function and the Tidyverse uses `slice_head()` which is one of the useful `slice` functions for selecting specific rows of a dataframe or tibble.

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()

surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  slice_head(n=6)
```

You can even use functions within `mutate`. Look at the code below and see if you can figure out how the `case_when` function works.

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex=="M"~"Male",sex=="F"~"Female"))
```

The `stringr` package within the Tidyverse contains a lot of useful functions for manipulating character strings. For instance, let's imagine that the genus 'Perognathus' has been mislabeled in our table and should instead be 'Peromyscus'.

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(genus = str_replace(genus,"Perognathus","Peromyscus"))
```

We can check this has worked by pulling the genus column, converting it to a factor and running a summary.

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
# summarise the genus column in surveys
surveys %>%
  pull(genus) %>% # pull extracts a single column
  as.factor() %>% # convert character to factor (categorical variable)
  summary()

# Try again, replacing Perognathus with Peromyscus
surveys %>%
  mutate(genus = str_replace(genus,"Perognathus","Peromyscus")) %>% 
  pull(genus) %>% # pull extracts a single column
  as.factor() %>% # convert character to factor (categorical variable)
  summary()

```

Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following criteria: Contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called `hindfoot_cm` containing the `hindfoot_length` values converted to centimeters. In this `hindfoot_cm` column all values are less than 3.

**Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

## Group_by and summarise

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **dplyr** makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarise()`, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. The `group_by()` function takes the column names that contain the grouping variables for which you want to calculate summary statistics. The `summarise()` function computes a summary statistic for each group using a specified function and variable. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can create multiple summary columns at the same time. For instance, we could add columns indicating the minimum weight and mean hindfoot length for each species for each sex:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(min_weight = min(weight),
            mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first and :

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(min_weight = min(weight),
            mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(min_weight = min(weight),
            mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  arrange(desc(min_weight))
```

## Count

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **dplyr** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarising it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count(sex)` is equivalent to:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n()) #n() counts the size of each group
```

If we wanted to count a *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```{r eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```
